### Problem

The primary problem with `long URLs` is their lack of user-friendliness and practicality in various contexts. Long URLs can be cumbersome to manually input, difficult to remember, and can exceed character limitations imposed by certain platforms, such as social media posts or text messages. 
> This can result in broken links, truncated URLs, or user frustration when attempting to share or access lengthy URLs in constrained environments.
